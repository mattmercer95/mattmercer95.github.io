                Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the 
                Eastern Hemisphere. It comprises the westernmost peninsulas of the continental landmass 
                of Eurasia, and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the 
                west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east. Europe is commonly considered 
                to be separated from Asia by the watershed of the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian 
                Sea, the Greater Caucasus, the Black Sea, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Although 
                much of this border is over land, Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent 
                because of its great physical size and the weight of its history and traditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Europe covers about 10,180,000 km2 , or 2% of the Earth's surface, making it the second smallest 
                continent. Politically, Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states, of which Russia 
                is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of 
                its population. Europe had a total population of about 746 million in 2018. The European climate 
                is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the 
                continent, even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe. 
                Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast.
